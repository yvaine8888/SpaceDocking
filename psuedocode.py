starter project
new function that updates schedule
    use for loop for each upcoming:
        calls the function that gets the available for the ship
        inside the function:
            it uses the for loop to check size of each bay
                adds to a list
            then it checks if the time is available by using the list of bays 
            and comparing the maximum to mininum to all the things already on the schedule
                To do that, I need a for loop and something that returns the first two as int
                adds to another list
            returns the first bay (the others would be for if I attempt level 4)
        still inside the for loop of the first function, update the schedule by appending
call the bonus
